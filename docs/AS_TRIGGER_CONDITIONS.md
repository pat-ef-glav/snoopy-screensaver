# ActiveScene Video Trigger Conditions Analysis

## Selection semantics

- The asset index contains 73 AS records representing 65 unique video IDs.
- 49 unique videos have contextual conditions; the other 16 are generic videos.
- Conditions listed for one video are grouped by family (weather, time of day, calendar, routine, hourly event). Within a family any listed value matches (OR); every family present must match (AND). `101_AS001` therefore needs icy or snowy weather *and* winter; a list with a single family is a plain OR.
- A match does not cause immediate playback. It only adds the video to the weighted random selection pool.
- Matching videos compete with generic videos and remain subject to recent-play and long-term play-count balancing.
- AS assets have no authored `dependencies` or `exclusions`; their restrictions come entirely from `info`.

## Weather conditions

| Condition | AS videos |
|---|---|
| Icy or snowy, in winter | `101_AS001` |
| Snowy or icy, in spring/fall/winter | `102_AS025` |
| Sunny or clear, in summer | `102_AS026` |
| Stormy | `103_AS042` |
| Windy | `103_AS043` |
| Rainy or stormy | `103_AS045` |
| Foggy | `104_AS064` |

The current project retrieves weather from Open-Meteo and maps it as follows:

- WMO `0–1`: `clear`, plus `sunny` during daytime
- WMO `45, 48`: `foggy`
- WMO `51–55, 61–65, 80–82`: `rainy`
- WMO `56, 57, 66, 67`: `icy` and `rainy`
- WMO `71–77, 85, 86`: `snowy`
- WMO `95–99`: `stormy`
- Wind speed of at least `29 km/h`: additionally `windy`

When weather support is disabled, no valid city exists, or the weather snapshot has expired, weather-only videos are not eligible. A video that also has a seasonal condition may still become eligible through that condition.

## Daily routine conditions

| Local time | Routine | AS videos |
|---|---|---|
| 05:00–09:59 | `morning` | `102_AS018`, `102_AS029` |
| 10:00–11:59 | `brunch` | `104_AS055` |
| 12:00–13:59 | `lunch` | `101_AS004` |
| 14:00–17:59 | `afternoon` | `103_AS033` |
| 18:00–20:59 | `dinner` | `101_AS004`, `103_AS044` |
| 21:00–22:59 | `bedtime` | `102_AS017`, `103_AS048` |
| 23:00–04:59 | `lateNight` | `103_AS034`, `103_AS048`, `104_AS062` |
| 07:00–10:29 | additional `goingToSchool` and `goingToWork` states | `103_AS037` |

The commute states overlap the ordinary `morning` or `brunch` state. They add `103_AS037` to the weighted pool without removing other morning material. Matching both states does not double its relevance score. A routine match has 3× the base relevance weight, while cooldown and long-term history balancing still prevent it from playing every time.

## Broad time-of-day conditions

| Local time | Time of day | AS videos |
|---|---|---|
| 12:00–17:59 | `afternoon` | `103_AS039` |
| 18:00–22:59 | `evening` | `103_AS039`, `103_AS041`, `104_AS053`, `104_AS057` |
| 23:00–05:59 | `lateNight` | `103_AS039`, `103_AS041`, `104_AS057`, `104_AS070` |

Time-of-day and holiday entries combine with AND across families. Consequently:

- `104_AS057` plays only on Lunar New Year, New Year's Day or the Fourth of July, and only in the evening or late at night.
- `103_AS039` plays only on Halloween, from the afternoon onward.
- `103_AS041` plays only on the first Peanuts comic-strip anniversary, in the evening or late at night.
- `104_AS053` plays only on New Year's Eve, in the evening.
- `104_AS070` plays only on New Year's Day, late at night.

Earlier revisions of this document described these lists as OR. The asset names only make sense
with AND across families (`ScenePalette_Cloudy_Day`, `SceneTransitionPair_ClockWipeExcludeLateNightBadWeather`,
the moon-phase visitors that list evening/lateNight plus one phase), and the runtime now evaluates
them that way.

## Seasonal conditions

| Season | Current local date range | AS videos |
|---|---|---|
| `spring` | March 20 through June 20 | `101_AS003`, `101_AS005`, `102_AS013`, `102_AS014`, `102_AS025`, `103_AS030`, `104_AS049`, `104_AS056`, `104_AS061` |
| `summer` | June 21 through September 21 | `101_AS003`, `102_AS013`, `102_AS014`, `102_AS026`, `103_AS030`, `104_AS049`, `104_AS060`, `104_AS061` |
| `fall` | September 22 through December 20 | `101_AS005`, `102_AS014`, `102_AS025`, `103_AS030`, `104_AS063` |
| `winter` | December 21 through March 19 | `101_AS001`, `101_AS005`, `102_AS025`, `103_AS038`, `104_AS063` |

### Season start dates

| Current fixed date | Condition | AS video |
|---|---|---|
| March 20 | `startOfSpring` | `104_AS056` |
| June 21 | `startOfSummer` | `104_AS060` |
| September 22 | `startOfFall` | `103_AS047` |
| December 21 | `startOfWinter` | `103_AS038` |

These dates are stable offline approximations. The screen saver does not calculate the exact astronomical equinox or solstice time for each year.

## General holidays

| Date or range | Event | AS videos |
|---|---|---|
| January 1 | `newYearsDay` | `104_AS057`, `104_AS070` |
| First day of the first lunar month | `lunarNewYear` | `104_AS057` |
| February 14 | `valentinesDay` | `102_AS020` |
| April 22 | `earthDay` | `104_AS054` |
| Second Sunday in May | `mothersDay` | `104_AS058` |
| Third Sunday in June | `fathersDay` | `104_AS058` |
| July 4 | `fourthOfJuly` | `104_AS057` |
| Entire month of October | `halloweenSeason` | `103_AS035` |
| October 31 | `halloween` | `103_AS035`, `103_AS039` |
| November 15 onward | `thanksgivingSeason` | `103_AS046` |
| Fourth Thursday in November | `thanksgiving` | `103_AS032`, `103_AS046` |
| Entire December and January 1–6 | `christmasSeason` | `103_AS036` |
| December 24 | `christmasEve` | `101_AS009`, `102_AS022`, `103_AS036` |
| December 25 | `christmas` | `101_AS009`, `102_AS022`, `103_AS036` |
| December 31 | `newYearsEve` | `104_AS053` |

The runtime also produces `aprilFoolsDay`, `peanutsCharlieBrownDay`, and `peanutsCharlieBrownThanksgiving`, but no current AS video uses these conditions.

## Peanuts and Snoopy anniversaries

| Date | Event | AS video |
|---|---|---|
| July 20 | `peanutsMoonlanding` | `104_AS052` |
| August 10 | `peanutsSnoopysBirthday` | `102_AS023` |
| August 19 | `aviationDay` | `102_AS012` |
| October 2 | `peanutsFirstComicStrip` | `103_AS041` |
| October 4 | `peanutsSnoopyDebut` | `103_AS040` |
| December 16 | `peanutsBeethovensBirthday` | `102_AS024` |

## Context currently unused by AS videos

The playback context calculates the following values, but no current AS video uses them:

- `onTheHour`
- `midnight`
- `midday`
- `sunrise`
- `sunset`
- Moon phases

These values may be used by other asset types, such as visitors, weather effects, or scene palettes.
