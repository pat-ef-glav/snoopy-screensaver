## Project Contents

This repository includes:

* The screen saver playback engine
* The Xcode project
* Asset loading and playback logic

This repository does not directly host any Snoopy videos, images, or other media assets.

An additional asset package of approximately **7.2 GB** is required to run the project. After downloading and extracting it, place the `SnoopyAssets` folder inside the project's `Resources` directory.

Example directory structure:

```text
SnoopyTVScreenSaver/
├── Resources/
│   └── SnoopyAssets/
├── SnoopyTVScreenSaver.xcodeproj
└── ...
```

## System Requirements

* macOS 14 or later
* Xcode
* An Apple Silicon or Intel Mac

---

## Building

The project includes `SnoopyTVScreenSaver.xcodeproj` with a single Screen Saver target.

```sh
xcodebuild \
  -project SnoopyTVScreenSaver.xcodeproj \
  -scheme SnoopyTVScreenSaver \
  -configuration Release \
  ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO \
  build
```

Supported processor architectures depend on the Xcode Build Settings and the resulting build output.

### Desktop wallpaper app

The same engine can run as a live desktop wallpaper (behind windows and icons,
every display) with playback-speed and power settings in the menu bar:

```sh
sh scripts/build_wallpaper_app.sh              # → .build/SnoopyWallpaper.app
SNOOPY_INSTALL=1 sh scripts/build_wallpaper_app.sh   # install to /Applications and launch
```

See [docs/WALLPAPER.md](docs/WALLPAPER.md). The Swift package also builds it
with plain `swift build` (targets `SnoopySceneKit` + `SnoopyWallpaper`).

If the project includes a post-build installation script, a successful build will install `SNOOPY.saver` to:

```text
~/Library/Screen Savers/
```

You can also install the screen saver manually by double-clicking the `.saver` file.
